However, this may take longer depending on your issuing bank. Once processed, we recommend checking your next billing statement for validation. We will process the charge back once the request has been made in the store.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How long is the credit voucher valid for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The credit voucher is valid for the 30 days, where the first day is the date of issuance. Please visit any of THE SM STORE branches to be able to use the voucher. Unfortunately, we will not be able to extend the validity of the credit voucher once it has expired.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can the credit voucher be reprinted if lost or stolen?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The credit voucher is as good as cash. Once the voucher is lost or stolen, we are sorry but we are not able to reprint it again. Please secure the credit voucher to ensure the barcode is still readable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I use my credit voucher for my next online transaction on shop.sm.com?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are working on this feature in the succeeding months. For now, credit vouchers may only be used at any of THE SM STORE branches nationwide.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How long does the replacement and refund process take?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Replacing your item\/s in any of THE SM STORE branches will only take a few minutes, given that all requirements are met according the Return and Exchange Policy. Once our Customer Service Associate has validated the item\/s and issued your credit voucher, you may already select a replacement item. Should the replacement item's price be lower than the credit voucher value, no refund shall be given. Meanwhile, you will need to settle any excess amount if the replacement item's price is higher than the credit voucher value.<\/p>\n<p>Should you prefer to request for a refund, credit vouchers shall be immediately generated while you wait in the store. However, for credit card charge back, it may take longer as it will be highly dependent on your credit card issuing bank. We recommend checking your next billing statement for validation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will my shipping fee be refunded when I return my item\/s?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since the courier has already performed its delivery service, we shall no longer include the shipping fee in the refund.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I received a cancellation notice from ShopSM. How will I get a refund?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are sorry for having to cancel your order. For prepaid orders, you don't have to do anything, as we will process the refund immediately for you. We encourage you to check your next billing statement to verify the refund.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>How much will I be refunded?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We will refund the amount you paid for the item, net of any promo vouchers used, shipping fee, and other discounts applied to your order. For discounted item\/s or item\/s on sale, the amount to be refunded is the amount you paid for and not the original selling price of the item.<\/p>"
